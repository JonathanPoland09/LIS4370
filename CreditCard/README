This package provides a set of functions designed to facilitate the handling and analysis of credit card data. 
Here's a breakdown of what each function does:

Load Credit Card Data:
This function reads the Credit Card dataset from a CSV file and returns it as a data frame.

Summarize Credit Card Data:
This function provides a summary of the Credit Card dataset, including descriptive statistics such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, etc.

Visualize Relationships:
This function creates a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two variables in the Credit Card dataset.

Preprocess Data:
This function preprocesses the Credit Card dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. It is a placeholder implementation that can be customized to fit specific preprocessing needs.

Split Data:
This function splits the Credit Card dataset into train and test sets, allowing for model training and evaluation.

Build Linear Regression Model:
This function builds a linear regression model using the train data. It is a placeholder implementation that can be replaced with actual model building code.

Evaluate Model:
This function evaluates the performance of a predictive model on the test data. It is a placeholder implementation that can be replaced with actual model evaluation code.

Detect Anomalies:
This function detects anomalies in the Credit Card dataset. It is a placeholder implementation that can be customized with anomaly detection algorithms.

Visualize Anomalies:
This function visualizes anomalies in the Credit Card dataset. It is a placeholder implementation that can be customized to highlight anomalous data points in plots.
In summary, this package aims to streamline the process of loading, exploring, preprocessing, modeling, and analyzing credit card data by providing a collection of functions tailored for these tasks. Users can leverage these functions to efficiently handle and gain insights from credit card datasets.
