CODE:



library(ggplot2)



Frequency <- c(0.6,0.3,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.6,0.3,0.4,0.9,0.2)

BP <- c(103,87,32,42,59,109,78,205,135,176)

First <- c(1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,1)

Second <- c(0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1)

FinalDecision <- c(0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1)



Important <- data.frame( BP, FinalDecision, Frequency)



# Plot histogram

ggplot(Important, aes(BP)) +

  # Add a histogram layer

  geom_histogram()




# Plot Boxplot

ggplot(Important, aes(BP)) +

  # Add a bar layer

  geom_boxplot()


Analysis:
I am not too sure if this was done correctly but based off of my data, code and the graphics I can make somewhat of an analysis. 
Looking at the numbers, it seems that understanding high blood pressure is kind of tricky â€“ there's a lot of variation and it's not as clear-cut. On the other hand, when it comes to low blood pressure, things are simpler and more obvious.
Lower values follow a more predictable pattern, making them easier to figure out. 
This difference in how we interpret high and low blood pressure shows that understanding high blood pressure readings is a bit more complicated, while low blood pressure readings are more straightforward.
