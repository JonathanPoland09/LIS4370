Code:

# Module # 2 Introduction to basic R functions and Data Structures - assignment

assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
# Define the myMean function

myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  
  return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2))
  
}  



MeanTest <- myMean(assignment2)


print(MeanTest)

OUTPUT:

> assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)
> myMean <- function(assignment2) {
+   
+   return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2))
+   
+ }  
> MeanTest <- myMean(assignment2)
> print(MeanTest)
[1] 19.25

Explanation:

The function correctly calculates the mean of a set of values by adhering to the standard formula. 
It takes a numeric vector as input, sums its values, and divides the sum by the count of values. 
Designed to handle any numeric vector with valid data, it provides a simple and effective method for calculating the mean in R.
